Mixed Reality technology can be applied to underground pipeline inspection training.  Utilizing dynamic 3-dimensional models and interactive animations, Mixed Reality simulates the inspection process and demonstrates the fundamental components of the system, including circulation pathways, heat exchanging processes, water pump driving, and temperature-pressure regulations by making abstract concepts more tangible. This approach eliminates the safety risks of traditional hands-on training while improving practical training efficiency
